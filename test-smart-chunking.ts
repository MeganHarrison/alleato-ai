[0:00] John Smith: Good morning everyone, let's start our project review meeting for the Port Collective initiative.

[0:15] Sarah Johnson: Thanks John. I'd like to begin by discussing our progress on the infrastructure redesign. We've completed 75% of the planned work and are on track to finish by next Friday.

[0:45] John Smith: That's excellent news. Are there any blockers or risks we should be aware of?

[1:00] Sarah Johnson: Yes, there's one concern. We're waiting on approval from the client for the final design changes. If we don't get it by Wednesday, it could delay our timeline by a week.

[1:30] Mike Chen: I can follow up with the client today. I'll schedule a call with them this afternoon.

[1:45] John Smith: Perfect, Mike. Let's make that an action item. Mike will contact the client today regarding design approval.

[2:00] Sarah Johnson: Moving on to budget. We're currently at 68% of our allocated budget, which aligns well with our 75% completion rate.

[2:30] Emily Davis: I have a question about the testing phase. When do we plan to start user acceptance testing?

[2:45] Sarah Johnson: Good question. UAT is scheduled to begin on March 15th, assuming we get the client approval this week.

[3:00] John Smith: Let's also make that a milestone. March 15th - Begin User Acceptance Testing.

[3:15] Mike Chen: I've identified a potential risk. Our lead developer mentioned that the new API integration might require additional security reviews, which weren't originally scoped.

[3:45] John Smith: That's important. Let's add that as a risk item and I'll discuss it with the security team tomorrow.

[4:00] Sarah Johnson: One more decision we need to make - should we proceed with the cloud migration in parallel or wait until after UAT?

[4:20] John Smith: Given our timeline, I think we should proceed in parallel. Does everyone agree?

[4:30] Mike Chen: Agreed.

[4:35] Emily Davis: Yes, that makes sense.

[4:40] John Smith: Great, it's decided. We'll proceed with cloud migration in parallel with UAT.

[5:00] Sarah Johnson: To summarize our action items: Mike will contact the client today, John will discuss security reviews with the team, and we'll proceed with parallel cloud migration.

[5:20] John Smith: Perfect summary. Let's reconvene next Tuesday to check on progress. Thanks everyone!
