### Current Status

âœ… Worker deployed and operational
âœ… Database connected (752 meetings ready)
âœ… API keys configured (Fireflies & OpenAI)
âœ… R2 storage connected
âœ… Schema aligned and ready
âœ… Cron job scheduled (every 6 hours)

### Next Steps

#### 1. Configure Fireflies Webhook

Go to your Fireflies.ai dashboard:
1. Navigate to Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
2. Add a new webhook with URL: `https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/webhook`
3. Select events:
   - Transcription Completed
   - Meeting Transcribed
   - Meeting Started (optional)
   - Meeting Ended (optional)

#### 2. Start Processing Existing Meetings

To download and vectorize your 752 existing meetings:

```bash
# Start sync to download transcripts
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/sync

# Process downloaded transcripts for vectorization
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/process
```

Note: Processing 752 meetings will take time. The worker will process them in batches.

#### 3. Test Vector Search

Once meetings are vectorized, test the search:

```bash
# Text search
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "project updates"}'

# Semantic vector search
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/vector-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What decisions were made about the Chicago project?"}'
```

### Automatic Processing

The worker has a cron job that runs every 6 hours to:
1. Sync new meetings from Fireflies
2. Download transcripts
3. Vectorize content
4. Update search indexes

### Dashboard

Visit https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/ to see:
- Total meetings
- Vectorization progress
- Recent meetings
- System status

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check worker logs: `wrangler tail`
2. Verify API keys are set: `wrangler secret list`
3. Check database: `wrangler d1 execute alleato --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meetings" --remote`
