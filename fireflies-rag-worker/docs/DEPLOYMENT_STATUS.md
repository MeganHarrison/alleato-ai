# Fireflies RAG Worker - Deployment Status Update

## ✅ SYSTEM FULLY DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL

### What We Accomplished

1. **Worker Deployed**: https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev
2. **Database Connected**: Using existing 'alleato' database with 752 meetings
3. **API Keys Configured**: Both Fireflies and OpenAI are authenticated
4. **Schema Aligned**: Database tables updated to match application requirements
5. **R2 Storage**: Connected and ready for transcript storage
6. **Cron Schedule**: Automatic sync every 6 hours

### Current System Status

```json
{
  "totalMeetings": 752,
  "vectorizedMeetings": 0,
  "totalChunks": 0,
  "status": "WORKING"
}
```

### Important Discovery

The existing 752 meetings in your database are NOT from Fireflies - they have IDs like "DOC_mdb35w26f9amm3d40ii" and no fireflies_id. These appear to be from another system.

### Next Steps

#### Option 1: Import New Meetings from Fireflies
```bash
# This will download NEW meetings from Fireflies
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/sync
```

#### Option 2: Process Existing 752 Meetings
If these meetings have transcript content already, you can vectorize them:
```bash
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/process
```

#### Option 3: Configure Fireflies Webhook
Go to Fireflies.ai → Settings → Integrations → Webhooks
Add webhook URL: https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/webhook

### Testing the System

Once you have transcripts (either from Fireflies or existing data):
```bash
# Search meetings
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "project updates"}'

# Semantic vector search
curl -X POST https://fireflies-rag-worker.megan-d14.workers.dev/vector-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What were the key decisions made?"}'
```

### System Architecture

- **Fireflies API** → Downloads transcripts
- **Cloudflare R2** → Stores markdown files
- **D1 Database** → Indexes meetings and chunks
- **OpenAI API** → Creates vector embeddings
- **Worker** → Orchestrates everything

The system is ready to process meetings from Fireflies as soon as they're available through the API or webhook.
