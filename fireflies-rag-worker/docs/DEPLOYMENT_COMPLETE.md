## Important Note

The deployment is currently connected to an existing database with 752 meetings. This appears to be from a previous deployment. The database schema is different from our new schema.

### Options:

1. **Use existing database** - Work with the 752 existing meetings
2. **Create new database** - Start fresh with the new schema

### Next Steps

If starting fresh:
```bash
# Create new database
npx wrangler d1 create fireflies-rag-new

# Update wrangler.toml with new ID
# Apply schema
npx wrangler d1 execute fireflies-rag-new --file=./schema-local.sql --remote

# Redeploy
npx wrangler deploy
```

If using existing:
```bash
# Run migration to add missing tables
# Then proceed with sync
```
